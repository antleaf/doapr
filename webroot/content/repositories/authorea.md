objectives: '"We founded Authorea in late 2012 with the mission of accelerating scientific
  discovery. We were frustrated that other writing tools didn''t fully understand
  the needs of researchers -- especially researchers in a web-first world -- and we
  wondered why the internet age hadn''t yet delivered a modern toolset for scientific
  collaboration."'
