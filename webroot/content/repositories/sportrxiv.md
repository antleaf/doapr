objectives: Encourage researchers within this field to prioritize research quality
  over publication quantity. We believe in providing education to empower researchers
  at all levels to adopt more rigorous research practices such as pre-registration,
  replication, open sharing of data, and sharing working documents (i.e., preprints)
  for feedback. As part of this initiative, we will deliver workshops with universities
  and funders to help researchers identify questionable research practices within
  the context of an incentivized publishing system and to explain the potential solutions.
