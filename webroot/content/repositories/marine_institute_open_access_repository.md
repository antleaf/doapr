  Yes - Eprints is hosted on a virtual server. We backup database and eprint items (pdfs etc..).

  We have a primary and backup database that is in sync and we backup the backup database nightly using standard mysqlbackup to a gzipped mysql file.
  We have a 2nd eprints server which we sync data (using cron and rsync)from the primary server hourly during work hours â€“ IIRC the primary server is backed up nightly using vmware backup tools.
  Our configuration is hosted in a git repository and this is also backed up nightly with standard gitlab backups.
