  Once the manuscript is published in the ARPHA-hosted journal, the status of the preprint changes to "Published in <the corresponding ARPHA-hosted journal>". Additionally, the citation details of the published paper will be made available along with those of the preprint, in order to prompt further citations of the paper rather than the preprint. ARPHA Preprints will link the DOIs of the two publications through CrossRef.
