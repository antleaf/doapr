It is becoming an increasingly common practice for researchers to share their preprints because it allows them to disseminate their research results quickly and openly with the rest of the world. As a result, there is a growing number of preprint-specific and generalist repositories that support the sharing of preprints.

This directory provides a list of preprint repositories that are available to the research community. It helps researchers find the most appropriate platform for them, enabling them to browse through existing repositories by discipline, location, language, functionalities, and other facets.

The directory is jointly managed by [Centre pour la Communication Scientifique Directe (CCSD)](https://www.ccsd.cnrs.fr/en/) and [Confederation of Open Access Repositories (COAR)](https://www.coar-repositories.org). The data in this directory was originally compiled through the GPPdP (Groupe Projet Plateformes de Prepublications) project, with financial support from the French [Ministry of Research's Open Science Committee (CoSO)](https://www.ouvrirlascience.fr/the-committee-for-open-science/).

To suggest a new repository, or provide feedback on a repository already included in this directory, please see the [feedback page](/feedback).
