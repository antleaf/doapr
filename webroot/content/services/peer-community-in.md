title: Peer Community in
service_id: peer-community-in
description: A community of scientists and researchers and a platform for assessing
  through open peer-review and possibly recommending preprints submitted by authors.
  No costs implied for users. Authors submit their preprints to get a recommendation
  after peer-reviews and editorial decisions. The recommendation is published by the
  PCI together with all peer-review material. However, the service does not publish
  the article because which stays on the preprint server and/or may be submitted to
  a journal (the decision is made by the authors).
