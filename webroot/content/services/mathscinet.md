description: Allow reviews of every mathematical research publication. The authors
  of reviews are volunteers, usually chosen by the editors because of some expertise
  in the area of the article. Often reviews give detailed summaries of the contents
  of the paper, sometimes with critical comments by the reviewer and references to
  related work. However, reviewers are not encouraged to criticize the paper, because
  the author does not have an opportunity to respond.
