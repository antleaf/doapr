description: A searchable online bibliographic database created by the American Mathematical
  Society in 1996. It contains all of the contents of the journal Mathematical Reviews
  since 1940 along with an extensive author database, links to other MR entries, citations,
  full journal entries, and links to original articles. Allow reviews of every mathematical
  research publication. The authors of reviews are volunteers, usually chosen by the
  editors because of some expertise in the area of the article. Often reviews give
  detailed summaries of the contents of the paper, sometimes with critical comments
  by the reviewer and references to related work. However, reviewers are not encouraged
  to criticize the paper, because the author does not have an opportunity to respond.
