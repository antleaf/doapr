description: SHAREâ€™s open API tools and services help bring together scholarship distributed
  across research ecosystems for the purpose of greater discoverability. However,
  SHARE does not guarantee a complete aggregation of searched outputs. For this reason,
  SHARE results should not be used for methodological analyses, such as systematic
  reviews.
