title: Crowdpeer
description: Allows open peer review of preprints. It provides a universal structure
  for reviews, separating the objective, quality related critiques of a paper from
  it’s perceived impact. Anyone can add a paper summary, highlight strengths and weaknesses
  of a paper and reply to others’ contributions. This encourages all aspects of traditional
  peer review to be covered - not only negative comments. A comment voting system
  allows for members of the community to collectively filter reviewer contributions,
  highlighting the most important comments and providing a more impartial final review.
