description: Episciences is a platform for overlay journals. The ambition is to provide
  the scientific communities with the technical means to produce quality journals,
  at a lower cost, widely accessible, by relying on open archives (Diamond Model).
  The submission of an article to a journal is done by a prior deposit of a preprint
  in an open archive. Episciences provides a website for each overlay journal. The
  articles are available in open access via the journal website and on the original
  Archive, whether or not it is accepted by the journal. Once the preprint has been
  peer-reviewed and accepted by the journal, the open archive used for the submission
  of the manuscript is updated with the publication references
