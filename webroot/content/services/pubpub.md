description: PubPub is an open-source, hosted, free-to-use content management system
  designed to help knowledge communities of all types collaboratively create and share
  knowledge online. PubPub’s flexible, extensible system allows communities to create
  the dynamic content that best represents their work, whether it’s a traditional
  academic journal, a book, a repository of interactive documents, a blog, all of
  the above, or something in between. If needed, PubPub then helps communities integrate
  their work into academic infrastructure like Crossref and Google Scholar without
  the need to remake it to conform to legacy expectations of how academic outputs
  are structured.
